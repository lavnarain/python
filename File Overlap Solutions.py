Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. 
One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of 
happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes, 
happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation 
is easier with an example, 
which I will describe below.)



#The solution without functions using a for loop (read on for the one with functions and the explanation)


primeslist = []
with open('primenumbers.txt') as primesfile:
	line = primesfile.readline()
	while line:
		primeslist.append(int(line))
		line = primesfile.readline()

happieslist = []
with open('happynumbers.txt') as happiesfile:
	line = happiesfile.readline()
	while line:
		happieslist.append(int(line))
		line = happiesfile.readline()

overlaplist = []
for elem in primeslist:
	if elem in happieslist:
		overlaplist.append(elem)
		
print(overlaplist)


#The solution with functions using list comprehensions (read on for the explanation)

def filetolistofints(filename):
	list_to_return = []
	with open(filename) as f:
		line = f.readline()
		while line:
			list_to_return.append(int(line))
			line = f.readline()
	return list_to_return

primeslist = filetolistofints('primenumbers.txt')
happieslist = filetolistofints('happynumbers.txt')

overlaplist = [elem for elem in primeslist if elem in happieslist]
print(overlaplist)
